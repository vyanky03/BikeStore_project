The dataset for this project was obtained from kaggle.com. SQL was used to study the dataset and creating the required table to be used further for analysis.
The table created using SQL was imported into Tableau and visualizations created to define critical business questions.
  1) Total revenue, units sold, and total order received
  2) Revenue/category, revenue/store and revenue generated per month.
  3) Top customers who spent money
